# 3D-Design
3D design of the case for the Presence Control device.

There are several versions of the case:
- Regarding the way it is fixed to the wall, it can be done:

  + Using a wall retrainer.
  + Using flaps screwed to the wall.
  + Using using the bottom case, so the crews are hidden.
  
- Regarding how to join the two cases (top and bottom), it can be achieved:

  + Using vertical screwing through both cases.
  + Using horizontal screwing by designing flaps in the top case.
